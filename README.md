**Background Article: Computer Crime Hits Local Bank**

National City Bank and Trust Company is the largest bank in the city, holding assets in the billions of dollars. In 1960, the bank computerized its operations and had considered itself fortunate for avoiding any issues with computer crime‚Äîuntil last week.

Last Wednesday, bank accountants discovered that a total of $400,000 was missing from several different accounts. So far, it is unknown where the funds were transferred. A police investigation has led to three possible suspects. These three individuals had easy access to the computer system that transferred the funds out of the bank.

**Scenario:** I am a detective investigating a recent robbery at National City Bank. Three suspects have been identified, each with access to the bank's computer system.
